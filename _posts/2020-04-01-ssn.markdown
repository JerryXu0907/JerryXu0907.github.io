We implemented a differentiable grouping module and combine it with off-the-shelf point cloud analysis frameworks (PointNet++). The module optimizes the embedding space to enforce the local feature consistency. The learnt mid-level abstraction can be used to discover geometry primitives as well as simplify the downstream tasks. With this module, we out-performed the original framework in point segmentation task.
