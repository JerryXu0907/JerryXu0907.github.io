We present HashEncoding, a novel autoencoding architecture that leverages a non-parametric multiscale coordinate hash function to facilitate a per-pixel decoder without convolutions. By leveraging the space-folding behaviour of hashing functions, HashEncoding allows for an inherently multiscale embedding space that remains much smaller than the original image.
