Our work learns natural, robust whole-body locomotion without privileged sensing, improving convergence, sample efficiency, and mirrored consistency. It delivers the first universal one-stage visual humanoid RL policy with a simple reflection-equivariant objective and fast depth rendering, achieving strong performance across varied terrains.
